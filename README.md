This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Before running the applicatoin, please run 
### `npm install`
in the project directory. 

To run the application, please run this command in the project directory:

### `npm start`

then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The application fetches and displays work orders with their id, description and deadline, as well as with the name, company and email of the worker responsible for the order. 

The orders may be sorted in ascending or descending order by their deadline using the toggle switch at the top of the page. 

They can also be filtered by the worker's name. In this app the filter functionality works literally, i.e. the name of the worker must be entered in full, and it is case-sensitive.
